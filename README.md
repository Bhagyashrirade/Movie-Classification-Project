## Project Overview
To build a machine learning model for classifying movies into categories based on features, while analyzing and improving model performance

# Features 
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and insights in the dataset.
- Applied One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables and StandardScaler for feature scaling.
- Used resampling techniques to address class imbalance in the data.
- Implemented Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression for classification.
- Applied K-Fold Cross-Validation for model evaluation and performance consistency.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Using Jupyter Noytebook
1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: You can run this project directly in jupyter without any local setup. 
2. **Upload the Dataset**: Ensure you have the `Movie_classification.csv` file uploaded to the same path where you save the project.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is `Movie_classification.csv`, which contains information about Movies, ratings, type, cast, and more.

## Outcomes
- Achieved an accuracy score of 68% for predicting movie categories.
- Evaluated the model's performance using a classification report, detailing metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Successfully implemented and compared Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression models.
- Enhanced model evaluation through K-Fold Cross-Validation, ensuring robust performance.
